Very simple CLI for converting linux epoch times into something human readable. Very much inspired by https://www.epochconverter.com.

== Usage

`epoch 1234567`

== TODO

- Handle fractional/float numbers
- Go through https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/index.html
- Add options to control output - e.g. suppressing utc or local
- Add options to force assumed unit
